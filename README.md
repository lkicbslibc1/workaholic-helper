# workaholic-helper
Aidy, Chatbot Assistant for Workaholic v.1.0. Inside this program, you can:
- Manage your work schedule:
      - Add, delete, or edit tasks or appointments
      - Prioritize tasks.
      - Receive a notification if the work is due within 3 days.
- Receive alerts if you have less than 9 hours of sleep to remind workaholics.
- Have Aidy summarize lengthy articles.
- Ask work-related questions, such as 'which software to use' or 'how to prepare for a presentation'
       - (you can leave information for Aidy to update as an assistant; I will update him later).
- Play games or ask for ways to beat boredom with Edi.
- Chat for fun (coming soon...).
